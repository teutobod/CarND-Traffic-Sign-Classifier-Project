## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

In this project, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

Further deatils about the used aproach can be found [here](writeup.md).

The implementation of the CNN, its training pipeline and its test results are here [here](report.html).
